# What is REACT ?
 A JavaScript library for building user interfaces built by facebook. It's everything JQuery wished it was.

# express-react-views

This is an [Express](https://expressjs.com) view engine which renders [React](https://reactjs.org/) components on server. It renders static markup and *does not* support mounting those views on the client.

This is intended to be used as a replacement for existing server-side view solutions, like [jade](http://jade-lang.com/), [ejs](https://ejs.co/)  (Like we have been using), or [handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/).


## Usage

```sh
npm init -y && npm install express express-react-views react react-dom
```

**Note:** You must explicitly install `react` as a dependency.

### Add it to your app.

```js
// server.js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.set('view engine', 'jsx');
app.engine('jsx', require('express-react-views').createEngine());

// routes here above listen

app.listen(port, (req, res) => {
  console.log("listening...")
})

```


### Views

```
mkdir views
touch views/Index.jsx
```

Under the hood, [Babel][babel] is used to compile your views to be code compatible with your current node version, using the [react][babel-preset-react] and [env][babel-preset-env] presets by default. Only the files in your `views` directory (i.e. `app.set('views', __dirname + '/views')`) will be compiled.

Your views should be node modules that export a React component. Let's assume you have this file in `views/Index.jsx`:

```js
const React = require('react');

class HelloMessage extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <div>Hello {this.props.name}</div>;
  }
}

module.exports = HelloMessage;
```

### Routes

Your routes would look identical to the default routes Express gives you out of the box.


```js
// routes here above listen

app.get('/', (req,res) => {
res.render('Index', {name:'John Doe'});
})
```

**That's it!** Layouts follow really naturally from the idea of composition.

### Layouts

Simply pass the relevant props to a layout component.

`views/layouts/Default.jsx`:
```js
const React = require('react');

class DefaultLayout extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <html>
        <head><title>{this.props.title}</title></head>
        <body>{this.props.children}</body>
      </html>
    );
  }
}

module.exports = DefaultLayout;
```

`views/Index.jsx`:
```js
const React = require('react');
const DefaultLayout = require('./layouts/default');

class HelloMessage extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <DefaultLayout title={this.props.title}>
        <div>Hello {this.props.name}</div>
      </DefaultLayout>
    );
  }
}

module.exports = HelloMessage;
```

### Where does my data come from?

All "locals" are exposed to your view in `this.props`. These should work identically to other view engines like we did with EJS, with the exception of how they are exposed. Using `this.props` follows the pattern of passing data into a React component, which is why we do it that way. Remember, as with other engines, rendering is synchronous. If you have database access or other async operations, they should be done in your routes.
