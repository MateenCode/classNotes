## C.R.A.P. Web Design

The four principals that may be the most important for graphic designers are:

**C**ontrast<br>
**R**epetition<br>
**A**lignment<br>
**P**roximity<br>

### Contrast
Contrast is the most effective way to add visual interest to your page. Contrast is also crucial to the organization of information - a reader should always be able to glance at a document and instantly understand what's going on.

#### Contrast using color
The famous adverts for the iPod expertly used contrast to focus the viewers attention on the music player. The ads featured a silhouetted character on a brightly colored background. The iPod and earphones appear in white and stand out clearly against the silhouettes and colored backgrounds.

A quick way to know if your design has optimum contrast is by looking at its grayscale version.

## Repetition
Repetition is simply the process of repeating elements throughout a design, or several pieces of design collateral to give a unified look. Repetition can be practiced with the color, shape, texture, size, and other attributes of the elements in a design. It helps users familiarize with the way information is presented to them.

### Alignment
Nothing should be placed on the page arbitrarily. Every item should have a visual connection with something else on the page. When items are aligned, the result is a stronger cohesive unit.

Always find something else on the page to align with, even if the two objects are physically far away from each other.

### Proximity
Unity helps all the elements look like they belong together.  The concept of unity describes the relationship between the individual parts and the whole of a composition. Unity in design is a concept that stems from theories of visual perception and psychology, specifically those dealing with how the human brain organizes visual information into categories, or groups.

When you create something, you already know which pieces of information are logically connected, you know which information should be emphasized and what can be de-emphasized. Express that information graphically by grouping it.

## Exercise

You've been given starter code for [a pretty awful looking website](starter_code).  Fix it up and make it C.R.A.P.!  

_Don't modify any actual content of the html_, except to change the `src` of the `<img>` tag.  Feel free to add `<span>` tags, or classes and id's to call upon the content.  

Completely stuck for ideas?  Pick your favorite hobby or season to theme your page.
