# Lessons Learned
- git pull upstream master
- Its okay if everything is not perfect, or some things dont work 
- You can never console.log too much
- Keep your projects simple. Pick one thing and start there. 
- Dont be afraid to get enough sleep
- Always ask questions
- Be kind to yourself
- Dont doubt yourself
- When the documentation doesn't make sense, take a break re-read it with a fresh mind, you'll figure it out.
- Before you reinvent the wheel, check to see if there is an npm package for it
- It is so much easier to make yourself a task list and do things one at a time than to just look at the project as a whole and do what you think should be done
- Commit strategically.  Especially if you’re working with an unfamiliar framework or dependency
- Talk through your app and what it does and how things connect to understand where you might have gaps you didn't see. Really detail it out - especially to someone who doesn't code! And do this before you write anything
- Work with a dev branch so you don’t accidentally break your main branch
- BUT FIRST COFFEE
- Take frequent breaks on days when you know you're going to code several hours. The days I got overwhelmed on this project were days I got obsessed with fixing a bug, and didn't get up from my desk for over an hour.
- some of the documentation out there is esoteric
- Everything resource you need has either been taught to you in this class or online somewhere, take your time and really try and understand what your actually looking for before getting frustrated.
- do not forget to eat
- look at a couple difference resources before diving into a tutorial you think will work and breaking everything.
- practice, practice, practice
- Make sure you're in the right folder
- having bugs in your program is more normal for development than not
- Read the comments before you commit to a tutorial. If it's a dumpster fire and impractical, YouTubers will tell on you.
- spellcheck!!!

- You’re more than capable
- when you see the picture of that GA student curled up in the bed. you will be that person look forward to it
