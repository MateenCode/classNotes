# Final Projects

## Schedule

**Saturday, July 18 through Saturday, August 8**

- During these weeks, you will be required to come for the first 30 minutes of class for a stand. 
- The class times will be optional and we will be learning new materials
- There will be TA hours at the usual times

<hr>

## Outline

During your final weeks, you will be creating your capstone project. 

Before you begin, note that this will be your pièce de résistance. This will be the site that you show off to employers, so really throw yourself into it.

You’ve come a long way, and it's time to show it. This will be your most advanced project to date, and if you put creativity into it, it'll hopefully be the thing you want to show off most prominently in your portfolio.

You get to call the shots and invent your own idea, choosing a framework and tools that are appropriate for what you want to build. Pull from everything you've learned so far, and tackle something that'll push you a little outside of your comfort zone.

Make sure you review your project proposal with your instructor so you can make sure it's something you can accomplish in the limited time we have, and make sure it's something that'll be impressive visually. Sometimes people do judge a book by its cover – or an app by its design.

## Requirements

### 1. Capstone Project

Your final project should be an app that

- Has an idea and technical stack (including database and server) that will be approved by the instructional team before you begin
- Full CRUD functionality
- Is hosted somewhere on the internet (Heroku,Netlify,Vercel...etc)

<hr>

## Potential Project Prompt Ideas

### Q&A App

Think of how helpful sites like Quora and StackOverflow are. Maybe there's some
other niche, or some surprising twist you can add to the question-and-answer
game.

### Car Repair Log

Keep up with your vehicle as you commute every day to your final weeks of SEI
save things like mileage, last inspect, oil changes, and maybe even receipts and
important document you need to have backed up.

### Email-like Messages

Imagine a realtime messaging client, but with private messages, an inbox, unread
messages, and who knows what else. This is your chance to re-invent email as we
know it.


## Technical Requirements (Final Project)
### &#x1F534; Mandatory to pass:
#### MVP - minimum viable product

* A **git repository (or repositories) hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted project,  and frequent commits dating back to the **very beginning** of the project. Commit early, commit often
* At **least** one Github commit per day
* **Be deployed online** and accessible to the public
* Have a **link to your hosted working app** in the `README.md` file in  each of your github repos
* Due to the open-ended nature of this final project, each project will have their own additional MVPs that are agreed upon by the instructional team
* Demonstrate that you can **teach yourself something new**, use a technology that you haven't used in class _NOR_ on a previous project
    <details><summary>Expand for a non-exhaustive list of examples:</summary>

        - 3rd party api
        - CSS - new framework
        - CSS - no framework but use CSS-grid
        - Rails - add another gem
        - Rails - use Active Record instead of PG 

        - Rails use the -api flag to just build a backend and connect at least one front end hosted elsewhere
        - React - integrate Redux
        - React - integrate React Router
        - React UI library: Material-UI, React BootStrap etc.
        - React Enzyme testing library
        - React - use axios instead of fetch
        - Node/Express - use a new npm package

        New Stack:
       
        - MERN stack : MongoDB, Express, React, Node
        - NERDS stack: Node, Express, React, Database SQL
        - PHP/Laravel 
        - Python/Django

        Module Bundlers:
        - Webpack - non-rails app
        - Webpacker - for rails app with react
        - Gulp 

        Other Front Ends:
        - React Native
        - Ionic
        - Vue 
        - Angular 5.0

        Authorization:
        - Authorization using JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

        Other Hosting:
        - Host on Digital Ocean
        - Host on AWS

        - Other Libraries:
        - Lodash 
        - Google Maps
        - Moment.js
        - jQuery UI

        - D3

        Other Databases
        - Firebase
        - Redis
    </details>

ALSO, don't forget: a **technical demonstration** of your app which:

* Is ~5-10 minutes in length
* Use 1-3 minutes to show off your portfolio then switch over and talk about your app
* Shows off the features of the app
* Be sure to talk about the new thing you taught yourself
* Explains the technical details
* Explains the technical challenges
* Explains which improvements you might make

## Project due date
**Saturday, August 8**<br>
 You'll present your final projects (portfolio inluded), and then we'll have a few graduation day activities. Attendance is of course mandatory!

## Meetings with Instructors
You need to send Madeline a DM in slack with all of the below items by Tuesday July 21,2020. We will approve project ideas so you can get started over Slack. 

Next, find a time to meet with Madeline on Zoom next week to go over your plan and scope of your project. 

Please set up a meeting with Madeline using this link: https://calendly.com/madeline-omoore/15-min?month=2020-07

**What you should work on before meeting with an instructor:**

- Create new Github repos outside of your class repository (also, don't forget to make a `.gitignore` file, as needed)
- Create your user stories and add them to your README.md
- Write what features will meet MVP and then list out other features as stretch goals
- Make wireframes and add them to your README.md (or put images and add links)
- Create a detailed [project timeline](https://git.generalassemb.ly/Software-Engineering-Immersive-Remote/SEIR-MAE/blob/master/unit_4/w22d1/homework/project_4/project-worksheet.md) just as you did for your unit 4 project. Make sure this is highly detailed.

  ## Suggested Ways to Get Started

  <details><summary>List of ways to get started</summary>

  * **Wireframe** Make a drawing of what your app will look like on each page of your application (what does it look like as soon as you log on to the site? What does it look like once a user logs in, etc.).

  <br>

  * **Break the project down into different components** (data, presentation, views, style, DOM manipulation) and brainstorm each component individually.

  <br>

  * Create your **user stories**

  <br>

  * Create a **Trello board** and break down the user stories into cards

  <br>

  * **Use your Development Tools** (console.log, inspector, alert statements, etc) to debug and solve problems

  <br>

  * Work through the lessons in class for help and inspiration! Think about adding relevant code to your application each day - you are given 5 days so that you can work on it in small chunks, COMMIT OFTEN. We will be looking at your commit dates and comments are part of your scoring.

  <br>

  * **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.

  <br>

  * **Consult documentation resources** (MDN, React, etc.) at home to better understand what you’ll be getting into.

  <br>

  * **Don’t be afraid to write code that you know you will have to remove later.** Create temporary elements (buttons, links, etc) that trigger events if real data is not available. For example, if you’re trying to figure out how to change some text when the game is over but you haven’t solved the win/lose game logic, you can create a button to simulate that until then.
