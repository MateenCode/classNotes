## Delete

Delete will also be a two step process, where we make the call to the database, and then update our state in order to update the view.


This is the function we'll be building, we don't have to write it yet, but we have to think about how it'll fit into our app.

```js
fetch('todos/' + todo.id,
  {
    method: 'DELETE'
  })
  .then(data => {
    this.setState({
      todos: [
        ...this.state.todos.slice(0, index),
        ...this.state.todos.slice(index + 1)
      ]
    })
  })
```

In order to delete, we'll need the id of the todo, additionally, in order to update the view, we'll have to have the index position so we can splice it out of our array. The `.map` function already has the index position available to us as an optional second argument, let's add it in.

```js
    {this.state.todos.map((todo, index) => {
```

Next we will add an `onClick` - we must be able to pass some arguments (the id, and the index). To do this, we'll have to use an anonymous function first, and then call our function to prevent it from being immediately invoked.

```js

  <ul>
    {this.state.todos.map((todo, index) => {
      return (
        <li>
          {todo.description}
          <button onClick={() => this.deleteToDo(todo._id, index)}> X </button>
          <small> complete </small>
        </li>
      )
    })}
  </ul>

```

Let's write our deleteTodo function and be sure to bind it in our constructor. For now, let's make sure we can console.log our id and index.

```js
state = {
    description: '',
    todos: []
}



deleteToDo = (id, index) => {
  console.log(id, index)
}

```

Let's add in fetch and update the view


```js
deleteToDo = (id, index) =>{
  fetch('todos/' + id,
    {
      method: 'DELETE'
    })
    .then(data => {
      this.setState({
        todos: [
          ...this.state.todos.slice(0, index),
          ...this.state.todos.slice(index + 1)
        ]
      })
    })
}
```

Remember, we have to use `...` ([spread/rest operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax)) in setState as to avoid directly mutating state. Additionally, arrays and objects are passed by reference (this is a great intermediate JavaScript topic to research as a hungry for more or post course)
