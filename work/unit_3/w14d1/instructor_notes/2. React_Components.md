## Thinking in React

The [React Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html) are a key resource. They are very well written, however a lot of the concepts can take a while to understand. So don't worry about having to read things a few times.

The React docs always recommend starting with a mock up of what the app should look like and then, break that mock up into a component hierarchy:

Then, you should build a static version in React.

Later, you'd want to start incorporating your data and using state/props (later lesson).

For now, let's build a static version of a small app

Below, we can identify several components

- app (blue)
  - div with the following inside:
    - header (red)
      - an `h1` inside
    - player scores (mustard yellow)
      - an `h2` and an `h3`
    - board (fuchsia)
      - squares (green)
        - an h4 styled to look good as a played X or O

### Let's Build our Mockup in React

- `mkdir react_tac_toe`
- `cd react_tac_toe`
- `touch index.html app.js`


Boilerplate HTML:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en" dir="ltr">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>React Tac Toe</title>
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react/16.3.2/umd/react.production.min.js"></script>
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react-dom/16.3.2/umd/react-dom.production.min.js"></script>
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/babel-standalone/6.26.0/babel.min.js"></script>
    <script type="text/babel" src="app.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="container">
      <!-- Let's load our App here -->
    </div>
  </body>
</html>

```

React Render a basic HTML Element

```js
ReactDOM.render(
  <h1> React Tac Toe </h1>,
  document.querySelector('.container')
)
```


#### Run a simple server:

**Important**  start this server from the same level as the `index.html` you want to render


- If you have python 2.x
  - `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`

- If you have python 3.x
  - `python -m http.server [<portNo>]`
  <br>
    ex:`python -m http.server 8080`

- If you want to use npm (are on Windows)
    - Install, if you haven't already, with `npm install -g http-server` (might need to run `sudo npm install -g http-server`)
    - run `http-server -o`

#### Important Note
- To see updates you must refresh your browser, all three of the servers above do cache things, so you may have to do a hard refresh (hold shift key when doing a refresh) to see your changes. Remember `command shift r` as the hot keys



### Our First Component

There are a few ways to write React components, some are outdated, some are bleeding edge/very new, some are for static components are some are for holding state.

For ease of learning, we are just going to learn to write our components one way. As you grow more experienced and comfortable with React, you can incorporate the right one(s) for your project.


**in app.js**

Declare a class that extends from `React Component`

At minimum, this class **MUST HAVE** a render function. The purpose of React is to make views, so a component must render some view.

```js
class App extends React.Component {
  render () {
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <h1> React Tac Toe </h1>,
  document.querySelector('.container')
)
```


Let's render that `h1` inside our render function and let's render our `App` in our ReactDOM.render function

```js
class App extends React.Component {
  render () {
    return (
      <h1> React Tac Toe </h1>
    )
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <App />,
  document.querySelector('.container')
)
```

When we refresh our view it should look the same.

##### If we've installed React Dev tools, we can go over to the React tab and see our component

## Making a Component inside another component

According to our mockup, our App will have 4 components
 - header
 - two player components
 - board

With react, we can only render **ONE** component. That component can have numerous components inside of it.

Let's make our header component

```js
class Header extends React.Component {
  render () {
    return (
      <h1> React Tac Toe </h1>
    )
  }
}

class App extends React.Component {
  render () {
    return (
      <div>
        <Header />
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```
We still haven't changed how things should look so let's use the dev tools to check everything is in order:

![react dev tools](https://i.imgur.com/ZZ2cteT.png)


Let's make a player scoreboard

```js
  class Player extends React.Component {
    render () {
      return (
        <div>
          <h2>Player </h2>
          <h3>Wins: </h3>
        </div>
      )
    }
  }
```

And have that component render in our app:

```js
class App extends React.Component {
  render () {
    return (
      <div>
        <Header />
        <Player />
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

Since a main feature of React is reusable components we can just copy our Player again:
```js
class App extends React.Component {
  render () {
    return (
      <div>
        <Header />
        <Player />
        <Player />
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

### A Sneak Peak of a Lesson in the Near Future

We know we have a player X and a player O, and we want to be able to customize our components. We can pass custom properties to our Player components, using `props` (short for properties). `props` is a special term in React. Let's see it in action.

Let's make a custom `prop` called `whichPlayer` and pass the appropriate player name

```js
class App extends React.Component {
  render () {
    return (
      <div>
        <Header />
        <Player whichPlayer='X' />
        <Player whichPlayer='O' />
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

Now, we need to access these properties inside our Player component. Our player component is a child of App, and thus has access to props. Don't worry if this doesn't make sense yet. We'll be returning to this concept over and over again and it'll start to come together.

```js
class Player extends React.Component {
  render () {
    return (
      <div>
        <h2>Player {this.props.whichPlayer} </h2>
        <h3>Wins: </h3>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

Now we can see our custom property `whichPlayer` rendering with its value, depending on which component it is:

![Props](https://i.imgur.com/Zieebv4.png)


Let's make one more component for our App, the board:

```js
class Board extends React.Component {
  render () {
    return (
      <div>
        the board!
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

Don't forget to add the `Board` component in our `App`

### You Do:

On your own, and then we'll review ~ 10 minutes
- make one more component called `Square`, made up of a div, inside the div put an `h4` element, inside the `h4` put some text like the word `square`
- gotcha! divs have a height and width of 0 when they are empty. Be sure to put in an `h4` and some text
- render 9 squares inside the Board
- **Extra** - Read ahead to learn how to incorporate CSS



### Complete Code:

```js
class Board extends React.Component {
  render () {
    return (
      <div>
        the board!
      </div>
    )
  }
}

class Player extends React.Component {
  render () {
    return (
      <div>
        <h2>Player {this.props.whichPlayer} </h2>
        <h3>Wins: </h3>
      </div>
    )
  }
}

class Header extends React.Component {
  render () {
    return (
      <h1> React Tac Toe </h1>
    )
  }
}

class App extends React.Component {
  render () {
    return (
      <div>
        <Header />
        <Player whichPlayer='X' />
        <Player whichPlayer='O' />
        <Board />
      </div>
    )
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <App />,
  document.querySelector('.container')
)


```
