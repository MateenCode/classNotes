## Activity

Congratulations everyone on completing unit 3! Now, let's move on to Unit 4! In this next unit, we'll be using a different programming language aside from JavaScript called Ruby. To get you prepared for tuesdays's lessons on it, we want you to at least see the new language in action and get some practice with it. Below, we've linked three different tutorials/guides that you can go through to begin familiarizing yourself with the language. It's up to you which tutorial you want to follow, and it's also up to you how much of it you go through, although we do have some suggestions below.

1. [Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/ruby) - you will have to create an account, but it's free!
1. [Learn Ruby the Hard Way](https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/ex1.html) - make sure to click the table of contents in the upper left corner to find more exercises

1. Writing an if/else statement
1. Defining a method/function and calling it
