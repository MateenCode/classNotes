# Project #4: Ruby on Rails - Solo or Group Project

## Overview

For your 4th project,you will be making a full CRUD app built with a React frontend and a Rails backend.


- **Saturday, July 11**: Project Presentations will be after lunch!

- We will then have a 1 hour assessment

## Technical Requirements
### &#x1F534; Mandatory to pass:
#### MVP - minimum viable product

* [Project Schedule Filled out and sent to Instructors](project-worksheet.md)
* **Rails backend**: Create a rails backend with all CRUD operations available across your models. 
	* Must have at least one model
* **React frontend**: Create a React frontend that consumes your Rails backend.
* **Deploy online:** Your app _must_ be deployed online to Heroku
* **Must be hosted on Github** with frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project. Commit early, commit often!
* At **least** one Github commit per day per member
* A **daily tracker** that all group members use (Trello, github issues, or another similar tracker)
* **A ``README.md`` file** with explanations of the technologies used, the approach was taken, unsolved problems, and notes to yourself/group members so you can come back to your project later and be able to pick up your train of thought, etc. As well as a **link to your hosted working app**


ALSO, don't forget: a **technical demonstration** of your app which:

  * Is ~5 minutes in length
  * All group members should speak during the presentation
  * Shows off all features of the app
  * Explains the technical details
  * Explains the technical challenges
  * Explains which improvements you might make


---

### &#x1F535; Not mandatory:
#### Recommended features - choose any

* Instead of a one-server build, try building the project with 2 separate servers (rails api, create-react-app frontend)
* Include **two or more models**
* Include either a one-to-many or a many-to-many relationship
* Use a **third party API** with a gem
* What about using **graphs or visuals** on your data? Chart.js , D3.js
* **Include portfolio-quality styling**
* **Use a CSS framework** like skeleton or bootstrap
* **Include wireframes** that you designed during the planning process (uploaded to your github repo) 
* **Authentication**
* **Implement React Router**
* **Implement Redux or Flux**

## Meetings with instructors

**Before July 8**

You or your group will either meet or message your instructor on slack to get your app idea approved. 

Message them if you would like to meet for 5 - 10 minutes. Otherwise you can write them a message on slack for quick approvals.

Be sure to write out what features you will need to build in order to meet MVP and some stretch goal ideas.


**Before you message your instructor**:

   - Meet to discuss your ideas with your teammate(s) and choose one idea
   - Create the project's Github repo *OUTSIDE* of the class repository.
   - Create some user stories and add them to your `README.md`
   - Write what features will meet MVP and then list out other features as stretch goals
   - Make wireframes and add them to your `README.md` (or put images and add links)
   - Create your project worksheet

## How to Submit Your Project
Your project is due on Saturday, July 11th at 2:30 pm EST. You will present your project and show your code to classmates and instructors.

:heavy_check_mark: *One* group member should fill out [this google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfUPnan89JtgRPEbK7GK2yXfUG18y5zzq3szuiXsQ6Md_Julw/viewform) with all information required as usual. Note that this will be the order you present!

## File Setup

- Each of you, locally, should create a new folder to house your Project_4. This folder should be outside of your class repo.
- One person should create the Github repository. When this person creates the new rails project this time, **don't** `--skip-git`, we actually want it to initialize git!
- Everyone should clone the repo from Github into the new Project_4 folder that they've created.
- Make sure everyone has a .gitignore! [Here is a list of useful .gitignores](https://github.com/github/gitignore).

## Heroku Deployment 

To deploy your app to heroku, [follow these notes](../../instructor_notes/DEPLOYMENT_HEROKU.md)

## Suggested Ways to Get Started

<details><summary>List of ways to get started</summary>

* **Wireframe** Make a drawing of what your app will look like on each page of your application (what does it look like as soon as you log on to the site? What does it look like once a user logs in, etc.).

<br>

* **Break the project down into different components** (data, presentation, views, style, DOM manipulation) and brainstorm each component individually.

<br>

* Create your **user stories**

<br>

* Create a **Trello board** and break down the user stories into cards

<br>

* **Use your Development Tools** (console.log, inspector, alert statements, etc) to debug and solve problems

<br>

* Work through the lessons in class for help and inspiration! Think about adding relevant code to your application each day - you are given 5 days so that you can work on it in small chunks, COMMIT OFTEN. We will be looking at your commit dates and comments are part of your scoring.

<br>

* **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.

<br>

* **Consult documentation resources** (MDN, jQuery, etc.) at home to better understand what you’ll be getting into.

<br>

* **Don’t be afraid to write code that you know you will have to remove later.** Create temporary elements (buttons, links, etc) that trigger events if real data is not available. For example, if you’re trying to figure out how to change some text when the game is over but you haven’t solved the win/lose game logic, you can create a button to simulate that until then.
