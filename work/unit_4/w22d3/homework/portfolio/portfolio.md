# Portfolio Site


## DUE ON TUESDAY
- A simple mockup of what you want your portolfio to look like!

Create a site that shows off your work.

We will be walking through the basics of setting up a Portfolio website together next Tuesday and Wednesday. 

All day Saturday you will be styling your Portfolios and showing them off to one another!

- We will be using React!
- No templates are permitted. Frameworks like Bootstrap, Materialize, Bourbon, etc. are okay, but templates like Hugo, Wix, Weebly, Squarespace etc. are **not** okay. If you aren't sure about it, ask an instructor.
- Deployed to github pages or hosted somewhere else
- Contains a list of your current projects (with links to the live sites)
