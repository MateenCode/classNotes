What if English ridded itself of redundancy? Here we explore the ramifications of eliminating
the letters `c`, `q` and `x` from the English alphabet completely. We replace them as follows

```
c => k
k => k
q => k
s => s
xo => ho
x => ks
```

## Interesting Results

Here are words that went through the most transformations. `quixotic` becomes `kuihotik`, and
is a perfect word to describe efforts carrything this project any further.

```
exchequer => ekskhekuer 3
exchequers => ekskhekuers 3
exotoxic => ehotoksik 3
quincunx => kuinkunks 3
quincunxes => kuinkunkses 3
quincunxial => kuinkunksial 3
quixotic => kuihotik 3
quixotical => kuihotikal 3
quixotically => kuihotikally 3
```
