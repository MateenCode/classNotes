# Sorting Algorithms in Python
A collection of implementations of several popular sorting algorithms.

* Bubble Sort
* Bucket Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Merge Sort

This repo contains implementations of the algorithms and runs each algorithm
against two test cases: one with a small array, another with a large array.

Write your solution for each sorting algorithm in the file **sorting_algorithms.py**
Running the program **test_sort.py** will show how long each sorting algorithm takes.

```
python3 test_sort.py
```
