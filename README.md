###### #hw-submission-procedure

### We will walk through this together the first time!

- Using that week's homework folder on your forked version of Github, push your changes to your repository from your terminal by changing into your repository from your terminal and running the following commands:
- `git add -A`
- `git commit -m "current week homework”`
- `git push`
- Fill out this [Google Form](s) with your github link for that specific homework. It will be the same Google Form for each homework.

## What We Expect From You

### Graduation Requirements

#### HOMEWORK

- Parameters for passing will be explained when the project is assigned.

#### ZERO ACCOUNT BALANCE

- Students must have no outstanding balances due on their account

#### ATTENDANCE

- Students must have at least an 80% attendance record (you’ve missed 24 hours total or less of class)
- Attendance is taken at the start of every class meeting.

- Students who have been excessively absent may be withdrawn.

You may have up to a three-day grace period period on a project for extenuating circumstances if you get approval before the due date.

Unexcused absences are not allowed. If you will have to miss a class, notify the IA/LI via Slack ahead of time so that we can mark your absence as excused. You may have a 48-hour grace period for notifying the IA/LI in case of emergency. Acceptable excuses include illness, death or critical illness to a family member of significant other, critical life emergency, and religious observances.

Students who have fulfilled all of the above requirements will receive a digital certificate of completion via email 1 week after to the course’s end.

## Additional Expectations

- Practice, practice, practice.

### Classroom Culture

Let's all agree to:

- Treat each other with respect
- Avoid bringing distractions into class
- Participate in class
- Be on video during class

### How To Succeed in a Remote Environment

- No distractions during class. This means no cell phones, children around.
- Make sure to speak up and speak out about any problems you are having! Don't be afraid to ask questions during class! Someone else is probably having this same issue!
- Carve out at least 10 hours outside of class a week for review and homework. Expect the next 6 months to be out of the norm for you. If you have to carve out a personal hour during a family vacation, you will have to do this!
- Make use of office hours! Find a time that works for you and don't cancel on your instructors :)
- Hold yourself accountable. Don't let yourself fall behind!

## Group Work Formats

We will be using breakout rooms to get create more personalized learning environments. Make sure to get to know your classmates and use eachother as teachers!
