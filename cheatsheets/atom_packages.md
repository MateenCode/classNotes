#Atom Packages & Notes

This document will recommend some of our favorite packages (plugins, add-ons, whatever you want to call them...they're awesome) for the Atom text editor. These give atom many of the features of a full IDE (Integrated Development Environment).

[Atom Website](http://atom.io)

To browse & install packages, (in the menu bar) go to **Atom** >> **Preferences** >> **Install** and search for your desired package. Click **install**. That's it!

There are links to the package documentation from the Atom site. You can also view instructions on how to use each package from the packages menu **Atom** >> **Preferences** >> **Packages**

##Recommended Packages
