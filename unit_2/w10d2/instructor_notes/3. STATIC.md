# Static Files

## Lesson Objectives

1. Create a static files folder for CSS/JS

## Create a static files folder for CSS/JS

- CSS/JS code doesn't change with server-side data
- We can toss any static files into a 'public' directory
    - static means unchanging
    - dynamic means changing depending on data

Let's set up a directory for our static code:

1. Create a directory called `public`
1. Inside the `public` directory create a directory called `css`
1. Inside the `css` directory, create an `app.css` file
1. Put some CSS in the `app.css` file
1. Inside server.js place the following near the top:

    ```javascript
    app.use(express.static('public')); //tells express to try to match requests with files in the directory called 'public'
    ```

1. In your jsx, you can now call that css file

    ```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/app.css">    
    ```
