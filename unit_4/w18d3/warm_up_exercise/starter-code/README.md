# Sass Calculator

Spend 5 - 10 minutes finding a calculator you find aesthetically pleasing or interesting (it can be in google images, in your house, on your phone). Draw a wireframe and take some notes.

Spend the next ~35 minutes building your calculator with HTML and Sass.

Spend the last 5 minutes showing off your calculator to your classmates!

## Set up

**In `morning_exercise` folder**
- `touch index.html`
- `mkdir css`
- `touch css/main.scss`
- start a new tab
  - `sass --watch css/main.scss`
  - some new files should generate, including `main.css` (inside your css folder)
- add some html boilerplate to your `index.html`
- link your `main.css` file to your `index.html`
- code inside `index.html` and `main.scss` - every time you save your changes in `main.scss` the `sass --watch` tab will watch for changes and compile your Sass to CSS.

- Do not worry about functionality. Just focus on making it look awesome.
